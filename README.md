## WGU C482 Final Project

Final project for WGU's Software 1 course (C482).

### Project Scenario

You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. They have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program.

I following a rubric, GUI mock up, and UML Class Diagram. I added a good amount of custom classes and methods on top of those.  
I used Java, JavaFX, and the NetBeans IDE. The GUI was made by hand, I did not use the optional GUI building software, SceneBuilder.
